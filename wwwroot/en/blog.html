                        <p>We perform constellations throughout our entire lives—from the very moment we enter this world until our last breath... And so it goes, each time. Sometimes the constellation is more successful, other times less so. Sometimes it is clear, other times not at all. But often, the most puzzling constellations leave a profound mark on our soul, while the clearest ones yield no visible result.</p>
                        <p>But the Soul—it doesn't mind; it is in harmony with the constellation process itself. Today in one, tomorrow in another... and so on, endlessly. I suspect it has idle moments, times when it gets utterly bored, and this can last for years. That’s why any constellation process feels thrilling to it...</p>                            
                        <p>And so, a person is born, and their constellation begins. For some, it is more successful. Perhaps because they intuitively know the rules? In my opinion, children should be taught "Constellations" as a subject in school. After all, children deal with family constellations every day, yet they remain unaware of the rules of the game. They grow up to become adults—still no rules. And often, even grandparents don't know them.</p>
                        <p>But thankfully, there are people who do know the rules — Facilitators. I am one of them as well, but the stories I share here are told by me as a "Client," or, with the client's permission, as a "Facilitator."</p>

                    <h4><em>The Third Eye (Ajna Chakra)...</em></h4>
                    <div class="content-wrapper">
                        <p>In Ajna – a log cabin in the midst of a vast, snow-covered forest – a hunter steps out, clad in fur boots, rifle in hand. Wolves, deer, and moose roam the woods. An old moose, fleeing the hunter, strikes him in the temple. The hunter falls and dies. The moose stands still for a long time, listening to the forest. Somewhere in the distance, wolves howl. He has two enemies – man and wolf. Slowly, he moves along the path. He is old, his teeth yellowed, his breath labored, his vision fading. He struggles to lift his heavy hooves, while the wolves draw ever closer… He collapses to his knees, realizing that the end is inevitable… In his vast eyes lies a deep sorrow, and a tear falls… Life was so beautiful. A love for existence overwhelms him. It is so hard to leave… Powerful emotions surge through him… The wolves are near… This is the end… The hunter’s soul watches from above in quiet wonder, feeling none of these emotions… To it, this is simply an endless, snow-covered wilderness and the end…</p>  
                        
                        <p>I am little Sonia, my father is a hunter. Antlers and wild animal pelts are everywhere. I touch them and imagine them alive, feeling their fur stir, sensing their knowing gaze, their soul. A deep sorrow and pain fill me, knowing that people kill animals, and even other people… I do not love humans; they are cruel, they are killers. Bitter tears stream down my face…</p>
                        
                        <p>I am grown now, telling my story. I live on an island in the ocean, the most beautiful and free of all islands, far from war, far from killing. I could never live where people take lives. People are different. Still, I do not love them… Only some of them…</p>
                        
                        <p>Little Sonia gradually finds peace, and in her Ajna, we see a magnificent, glowing violet crystal. Around her are many animals – moose, deer, roe deer – but no wolves… The animals, too, have crystals, and their large, intelligent eyes brim with feeling. There are people as well, many of them, but sadly, only a few have shining crystals in their Ajna…</p>

                    <h4>Story One... There Is No Chronology Here, Just Like in Constellations...</h4>
                    <div class="content-wrapper">
                    <p>I gazed at the sky—or rather, I stared into the block of ice surrounding me. It was blue, tinged with shades of indigo or perhaps a soft violet, much like my eyes. My curly, light hair was frozen artfully as if caught in a breeze within the icy embrace of this azure block. I was naked, seemingly suspended. Snowflakes settled on the ice, their intricate shapes remarkably clear...</p> <p>But I had been clothed when I entered the icy sanctuary. A piece of stone broke off and pierced my head. Blood soaked my garments. I felt no pain—after all, the brain doesn’t register it. I removed my clothes, yet the blood continued to stream down my beautiful, pale body with a subtle olive hue. And they considered me unattractive?! Oh, gods, who, then, could be called beautiful? Though, admittedly, my mother with her alabaster skin and jet-black hair was truly a beauty. My father had seen it too.</p> <p>It is through his eyes that I now see these people gathered around the block of ice, gawking at me... *A divine punishment encased by a god,* murmured the crowd. Nonsense. I had simply leapt towards the waterfall to wash away the blood and lost my footing. The icy waters swept me into an underground lake, carrying me to the river. I ended up in a cove of blue clay, where I remained. They carefully carved me out and put me on display. *Whoever defies the god’s decrees and strays from the path will face retribution.*</p> <p>A compass for that path—that is what my descendants need. Though I have no children. Never mind; I’ll embed this code into the soul for its future incarnations. Let them follow the course. And they did—five times, for five centuries, or perhaps millennia. Souls aren’t adept at mathematics, and for them, time is but a stream.</p> <p>But in the sixth instance, I emerged again. This internal compass restrained me because I was treading an uncharted path, yet it was my path. Each misstep tightened an iron boot around my mind—again and again. For half a century, I’ve been prying apart its metal bars. The sixth decade has arrived—and so, the number six revealed itself.</p> <p>A couple of years ago, I had already glimpsed her—or myself?—encased in ice. Here’s what I wrote that day: <em>“I have blue eyes and very light curly hair (though in reality my eyes are brown, and my hair is dark and straight). I lie naked, half-reclined, in a bluish-transparent block of ice, its facets cut like those of a massive diamond. I am completely encased in ice… and it is exquisite. I look outwards and see snowflakes swirling lazily in the air, surrounded by snow-covered mountains and forests. I feel no fear. I am exactly where I should be. I feel the same grandeur and tranquility as the unparalleled nature around me…”</em>.</p> <p>She had come to show what happens to those who stray from the path and to ensure the compass was aligned.</p> <p>It seems doubts about me arose, and the allowed radius began to expand. Our next meeting took place at a Constellation session. She passed on her love and the right to choose my own direction. Well then, let’s take a stroll, explore, and attempt to transform the iron boot into wings. As they say, time will tell...</p> <p><b>The inquiry was about a headache...</b> The Constellation session was magical—my first in Madeira, and my first karmic one. <em>December 2022</em></p>

                        <p>I stood on a mountain, arms outstretched. My eyes were closed, yet through my eyelids, I sensed the sun's glimmers... My arms were spread wide and lifted – I was catching the wind... no, not the wind – it was a flow, an energy I always knew how to find and move with... Creating extraordinary projects that brought immense returns... Sometimes it was vivid, sometimes less so. But I lost it... I got stuck and stopped... I was utterly empty without it... Four years have passed, and I still stand alone, completely empty and motionless... And only in my heart does something stir – pain and longing... and fear... a double sorrow for two losses that always stays with me...</p>
                        <p>Her name was Lina... She was my friend, my partner, my inner strength, my soul... Cities and countries passed before us, sometimes even continents... You gave me so much, and I gave you even more... You went to another continent, and I was left stranded here, outside of life... But it’s time to move forward, time to choose life. I keep all the gifts you gave me, and I return yours – use them as you see fit. I keep all the memories of our meetings, but now I choose myself... I choose my life...</p>
                        <p>His name was Jev – my best business project. It was passion, drive; I had never felt more alive... And it was mutual... People, money, resources – everything came as if by magic... And then it stopped, just as suddenly. It was like an engine in a speeding car that jumped, broke apart, and vanished... It died slowly... I supported it with all my might for as long as I could. And then there were only two of us left – a memory of life, but I wouldn’t let go of it. “Business is always a risk, 50/50,” said old Jev. “When you let me go, you’ll also release the fear of new loss. It’s over for me...” And I agreed...</p>
                        <p>My new project stood close by, waiting for attention and love. I looked at it, and a new connection began to form. Investors joined us, watching closely and sternly, expecting my energy and passion. I was coming back...</p>

                    <h4>Story Three... <em>Decoding a Dream</em></h4>
                    <div class="content-wrapper">
                        
                        <p>I am very small, just 4-5 months old. My wide-open eyes dart back and forth, back and forth, searching for the source of my unease. Turning slightly to my right, I saw my father and what lay within him… It was his tormented, withered soul, and it terrified me. I tried to help, but it was impossible. His soul was completely consumed by dark matter… just cold, despair, and a numbing stillness came over me from that contact. I know this stillness—a complete loss of self-identity, preventing any connection with the real world. If I don’t exist, how can I interact with anything beyond myself?</p>
                        <p>But how does my father cope with this entity? How did it come to inhabit him? He seemed perfectly at ease with it. It entered him as a boy, capturing his soul through a street cat that scratched his face. For him, it was comfortable—living thoughtlessly, drunkenly, and carelessly with dark matter instead of a soul. But life came to an end, and the entity began seeking a new body, a new victim. It found me thousands of kilometers away, drawn by that familiar stillness… My brave cat Barsik fought it off; his entire face was scratched, and the wounds wouldn’t heal. The entity clung to him, hoping to find its new host…</p>
                        <p>Now I see you, dark matter. There is no place for you in me. I no longer need to help my father—his fate is his own. I am small, and he is big. I held my little one in my arms and felt overwhelming tenderness and love. Light was born in my soul, and the gray sticky shreds of the entity drifted away from our fingers… our faces, necks, and chests. The light grew brighter, dissolving the darkness. Reality began to emerge… Life filled me…</p>
                        <p><em>P.S. Barsik’s face healed quickly, and after catching up on sleep, my brave savior returned to hunting field mice…</em></p>

                    <h4>Story Four... <em>The Work of the Mind</em></h4>
                    <div class="content-wrapper">
                        <img src="/images/kub3.svg" alt="kube" class="kube" width="48" height="48"> 
                    <p>I am the Brain—large, pale, and intricately grooved. I am completely exposed from above, but my capabilities far exceed my physical size. I extend far beyond the boundaries allowed by my host (that is, Me, the Client), yet I cannot operate with a 360-degree scope. My active sectors can span multiple roles simultaneously—for example, I can be the Client, the Constellation Facilitator, and a Representative all within one sector… then shift to being a copywriter, writer, lawyer, or translator in another. But switching between them requires effort.</p>
                    <p>The switch is a rather crude mechanism. If the Brain could feel pain, it would describe this process as painful. It’s energy-intensive. One moment I’m the Facilitator, and then—snap!—a rough handle jerks me over to Quality Control Engineer. The process is a chaotic, agonizing expenditure.</p>
                    <p>There are two solutions. The first is taking breaks between switches—allowing for profound bodily relaxation, letting the body settle. The switch’s handle moves out of phase, rising higher and transitioning to another sector without scraping against the Brain. What bliss—context switching becomes painless!</p>
                    <p>The second solution is that I (the Brain) need a Protective Plate. I crave it! Now, the switch slides against the Plate rather than me. The Plate is made of a firm material, while the switch becomes more pliable, adapting to the Plate’s surface. I am safe!</p>
                    <p>I (the Brain) recall when I was physically injured in an accident. I fully recovered and even enhanced my abilities, but maintaining a 360-degree awareness has always been too much. Besides, the doctors promised (and this was a fact) to attach a plate to the damaged area of my skull.</p>
                    <p>I (the Client) realized I no longer need to monitor everything indiscriminately at 360 degrees. I can work selectively, but on a massive scale and with great reach. By combining deep relaxation and a safety Plate for transitioning between activities, I achieve balance. The most astonishing part? This virtual Plate materialized on my head just a couple of hours after the Constellation session. My Brain is saved; it’s secure… I am secure. <b>The fragmented fracture at the base of my skull healed five years ago without surgery, but my Brain still carried the trauma, waiting for the promised protection. Now it has it, and it’s finally over...</b></p>
                    <p><b>Inquiry: Difficulty in context switching. Figures involved: Client, Brain, and Switch, with the Protective Plate added during the process.</b></p>
