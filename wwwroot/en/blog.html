                    <h4>Introduction... From Birth to Death... Easily Skippable...</h4>
                    <div class="content-wrapper"> 
                        <p>We perform constellations throughout our entire lives—from the very moment we enter this world until our last breath... And so it goes, each time. Sometimes the constellation is more successful, other times less so. Sometimes it is clear, other times not at all. But often, the most puzzling constellations leave a profound mark on our soul, while the clearest ones yield no visible result.</p>
                        <p>But the Soul—it doesn't mind; it is in harmony with the constellation process itself. Today in one, tomorrow in another... and so on, endlessly. I suspect it has idle moments, times when it gets utterly bored, and this can last for years. That’s why any constellation process feels thrilling to it...</p>                            
                        <p>And so, a person is born, and their constellation begins. For some, it is more successful. Perhaps because they intuitively know the rules? In my opinion, children should be taught "Constellations" as a subject in school. After all, children deal with family constellations every day, yet they remain unaware of the rules of the game. They grow up to become adults—still no rules. And often, even grandparents don't know them.</p>
                        <p>But thankfully, there are people who do know the rules — Facilitators. I am one of them as well, but the stories I share here are told by me as a "Client," and only rarely, with the client's permission, as a "Facilitator."</p>

                    <h4>Story One... There Is No Chronology Here, Just Like in Constellations...</h4>
                    <div class="content-wrapper">
                        <p>I looked up at the sky—or rather, I stared into the block of ice that encased me. It was blue, with hints of violet or even deep blue tones. Just like my eyes. My curly light hair was artistically frozen, as if caught mid-wave by the wind, embedded in the blue ice. I was naked, seemingly floating. Snow fell onto the ice block. The snowflakes were exquisitely clear...</p>  
                        <p>Yet, I had been clothed when I entered the icy sanctuary. A piece of stone broke off and pierced my head. Blood soaked my clothing. I felt no pain; after all, the brain does not know it. I removed my clothes, but the blood continued streaming down my beautiful white skin, which had a faint olive hue. And they called me unattractive? Oh gods, then who can be considered beautiful? Though, admittedly, my mother—with her fair skin and black hair—was truly so. And he saw that beauty, my father.</p>
                        <p>It is through his eyes that I now see all these people standing around the block of ice, gawking at me... "Divine retribution, bound by the gods," murmured the crowd. What nonsense. I had simply rushed to the waterfall to wash away the blood, lost my footing, and was swept away by the icy water into an underground lake, which carried me to a river. I ended up in a cove filled with blue clay. There, they found me, carefully carved me out, and put me on display. Those who defy divine prohibitions, who stray from the path—will be punished.</p>
                        <p>A compass for that path—that’s what my descendants need. Although, I have no children. Fine, I’ll embed this code into the soul for its future incarnations. Let them follow the course. And they did, for five times, across five centuries—or perhaps millennia. The soul isn’t great at math, and for it, time is merely a stream.</p>    
                        <p>But on the sixth time, there I was. And this inner compass restrained me because I was heading the wrong way—but it was my way. Heading the wrong way—a steel boot clamps down on my head. Wrong way—again and again. And I continued on, prying apart the steel boot’s bars for half a century now. The sixth decade begins—and there's that number six again.</p>
                        <p>Once, three years ago, I must have gone *too* far "off course." My skull was fractured in three places—a comminuted fracture at the base of the skull, brain damage, a temporary loss of memory...</p>
                        <p>A year later, I saw her—or was it myself?—inside the block of ice. Here’s what I wrote that day: <em>"I have blue eyes and very light, curly hair (in reality, my eyes are brown, my hair dark and straight), and I am reclining, naked, in a bluish-transparent block of ice, its edges cut like those of a giant diamond. I am completely encased in ice... and it is beautiful. I look outward and see snowflakes slowly swirling through the air, surrounded by snow-covered mountains and forests. I feel no fear. I am where I’m supposed to be. I feel the same majesty and serenity as the unparalleled nature around me…”</em></p>
                        <p>She came to show me what happens to those who stray from the path—and to check if the compass was properly calibrated.</p>
                        <p>It seems there were doubts about me, and the allowed radius began to expand. A new encounter occurred during a Constellation. She passed on to me her love and the right to choose my direction. Well then, let’s take a walk, look around, and try turning the steel boot into wings. As they say, we’ll see how it goes...</p>
                        <p><b>The issue was about a headache...</b> My headaches lessened significantly... The Constellation was magical—my first on Madeira, my first karmic one...<em>December 2022</em></p>
