                        <p>We perform constellations throughout our entire lives—from the very moment we enter this world until our last breath... And so it goes, each time. Sometimes the constellation is more successful, other times less so. Sometimes it is clear, other times not at all. But often, the most puzzling constellations leave a profound mark on our soul, while the clearest ones yield no visible result.</p>
                        <p>But the Soul—it doesn't mind; it is in harmony with the constellation process itself. Today in one, tomorrow in another... and so on, endlessly. I suspect it has idle moments, times when it gets utterly bored, and this can last for years. That’s why any constellation process feels thrilling to it...</p>                            
                        <p>And so, a person is born, and their constellation begins. For some, it is more successful. Perhaps because they intuitively know the rules? In my opinion, children should be taught "Constellations" as a subject in school. After all, children deal with family constellations every day, yet they remain unaware of the rules of the game. They grow up to become adults—still no rules. And often, even grandparents don't know them.</p>
                        <p>But thankfully, there are people who do know the rules — Facilitators. I am one of them as well, but the stories I share here are told by me as a "Client," or, with the client's permission, as a "Facilitator."</p>

                    <h4>Story One... There Is No Chronology Here, Just Like in Constellations...</h4>
                    <div class="content-wrapper">
                    <p>I gazed at the sky—or rather, I stared into the block of ice surrounding me. It was blue, tinged with shades of indigo or perhaps a soft violet, much like my eyes. My curly, light hair was frozen artfully as if caught in a breeze within the icy embrace of this azure block. I was naked, seemingly suspended. Snowflakes settled on the ice, their intricate shapes remarkably clear...</p> <p>But I had been clothed when I entered the icy sanctuary. A piece of stone broke off and pierced my head. Blood soaked my garments. I felt no pain—after all, the brain doesn’t register it. I removed my clothes, yet the blood continued to stream down my beautiful, pale body with a subtle olive hue. And they considered me unattractive?! Oh, gods, who, then, could be called beautiful? Though, admittedly, my mother with her alabaster skin and jet-black hair was truly a beauty. My father had seen it too.</p> <p>It is through his eyes that I now see these people gathered around the block of ice, gawking at me... *A divine punishment encased by a god,* murmured the crowd. Nonsense. I had simply leapt towards the waterfall to wash away the blood and lost my footing. The icy waters swept me into an underground lake, carrying me to the river. I ended up in a cove of blue clay, where I remained. They carefully carved me out and put me on display. *Whoever defies the god’s decrees and strays from the path will face retribution.*</p> <p>A compass for that path—that is what my descendants need. Though I have no children. Never mind; I’ll embed this code into the soul for its future incarnations. Let them follow the course. And they did—five times, for five centuries, or perhaps millennia. Souls aren’t adept at mathematics, and for them, time is but a stream.</p> <p>But in the sixth instance, I emerged again. This internal compass restrained me because I was treading an uncharted path, yet it was my path. Each misstep tightened an iron boot around my mind—again and again. For half a century, I’ve been prying apart its metal bars. The sixth decade has arrived—and so, the number six revealed itself.</p> <p>A couple of years ago, I had already glimpsed her—or myself?—encased in ice. Here’s what I wrote that day: <em>“I have blue eyes and very light curly hair (though in reality my eyes are brown, and my hair is dark and straight). I lie naked, half-reclined, in a bluish-transparent block of ice, its facets cut like those of a massive diamond. I am completely encased in ice… and it is exquisite. I look outwards and see snowflakes swirling lazily in the air, surrounded by snow-covered mountains and forests. I feel no fear. I am exactly where I should be. I feel the same grandeur and tranquility as the unparalleled nature around me…”</em>.</p> <p>She had come to show what happens to those who stray from the path and to ensure the compass was aligned.</p> <p>It seems doubts about me arose, and the allowed radius began to expand. Our next meeting took place at a Constellation session. She passed on her love and the right to choose my own direction. Well then, let’s take a stroll, explore, and attempt to transform the iron boot into wings. As they say, time will tell...</p> <p><b>The inquiry was about a headache...</b> The Constellation session was magical—my first in Madeira, and my first karmic one. <em>December 2022</em></p>

                    <h4>Second Story... <em>November 18, 2024</em></h4>
                    <div class="content-wrapper">
                        <img src="/images/kub31.svg" alt="kube" class="kube" width="48" height="48">
                        <p>I am the Brain—large, pale, and intricately grooved. I am completely exposed from above, but my capabilities far exceed my physical size. I extend far beyond the boundaries allowed by my host (that is, Me, the Client), yet I cannot operate with a 360-degree scope. My active sectors can span multiple roles simultaneously—for example, I can be the Client, the Constellation Facilitator, and a Representative all within one sector… then shift to being a copywriter, writer, lawyer, or translator in another. But switching between them requires effort.</p>
                        <p>The switch is a rather crude mechanism. If the Brain could feel pain, it would describe this process as painful. It’s energy-intensive. One moment I’m the Facilitator, and then—snap!—a rough handle jerks me over to Quality Control Engineer. The process is a chaotic, agonizing expenditure.</p>
                        <p>There are two solutions. The first is taking breaks between switches—allowing for profound bodily relaxation, letting the body settle. The switch’s handle moves out of phase, rising higher and transitioning to another sector without scraping against the Brain. What bliss—context switching becomes painless!</p>
                        <p>The second solution is that I (the Brain) need a Protective Plate. I crave it! Now, the switch slides against the Plate rather than me. The Plate is made of a firm material, while the switch becomes more pliable, adapting to the Plate’s surface. I am safe!</p>
                        <p>I (the Brain) recall when I was physically injured in an accident. I fully recovered and even enhanced my abilities, but maintaining a 360-degree awareness has always been too much. Besides, the doctors promised (and this was a fact) to attach a plate to the damaged area of my skull.</p>
                        <p>I (the Client) realized I no longer need to monitor everything indiscriminately at 360 degrees. I can work selectively, but on a massive scale and with great reach. By combining deep relaxation and a safety Plate for transitioning between activities, I achieve balance. The most astonishing part? This virtual Plate materialized on my head just a couple of hours after the Constellation session. My Brain is saved; it’s secure… I am secure. <b>The fragmented fracture at the base of my skull healed five years ago without surgery, but my Brain still carried the trauma, waiting for the promised protection. Now it has it, and it’s finally over...</b></p>
                        <p><b>Inquiry: Difficulty in context switching. Figures involved: Client, Brain, and Switch, with the Protective Plate added during the process.</b></p>
